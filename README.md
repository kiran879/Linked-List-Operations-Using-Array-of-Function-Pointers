# Linked-List-Operations-Using-Array-of-Function-Pointers in C

This project implements various operations on a linked list in C using modular programming, function pointers, and shell scripting. It also includes custom scripts for logging and testing, managed using RCS (Revision Control System).

## Features:
- **Linked List Operations**: Includes creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal of linked lists.
- **Function Pointers**: Used for managing different operations on the linked list.
- **Modular Programming**: Code is divided into multiple files for better maintainability and readability.
- **Shell Scripting**:
  - **logScript**: Generates daily logs of program execution.
  - **testScript**: Runs the program and displays the result.
- **Version Control (RCS)**: Source code managed using RCS for version tracking.
## Requirements:
- **C Compiler**: Ensure GCC or any compatible C compiler is installed.
- **Bash Shell**: For running shell scripts.
- **RCS**: For version control.
## How to Run:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kiran879/Linked-List-Operations-Using-Array-of-Function-Pointers.git
   cd Linked-List-Operations-Using-Array-of-Function-Pointers

Make testScript Executable: Before running the testScript, make sure it has executable permissions
run ./testScript
